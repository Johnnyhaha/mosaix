# Mosaix - An iOS Photo Mosaic App
### Nathan Eliason & Shelly Bensal
<em>Updated May 10th, 2017</em>

## Summary
______

We created an iOS application which uses the Metal framework to generate photo mosaics in parallel, on-demand. Using the photos already in the device's Photo Library, Mosaix reconstructs the reference photo by selecting photos which match in color, shape, and contrast and placing them in a grid pattern representing the original image. _Our iOS app currently exhibits about 20x speedup over the leading photo mosaic applications available in the App Store._

</p>

#### Features
 - Full graphic user interface with automatic photo library access, an in-app camera and photo selector, and the ability to save mosaics.
 - Functional with a Photo Library with between 4 and 15,000 photos.
 - Adjustable grid size and final quality -- letting the user select how large each source image is framed within the final composite photo and how picky the algorithm is in its selection.
 - Naive and basic parallel photo selection algorithms, with an iterative approach to building a robust, performant data structure.
 - Pre-processing of the device's Photo Library that reduces complexity and time of the generation of each individual mosaic, and loading values previously computed from file to decrease the time required for steady-state photo mosaic production.
 - Performance that improves upon existing solutions in the app store. While there are a few apps already that perform similar functions to Mosaix, they consume 30-40s per image to finish processing (depending on grid size and quality).
- Processing of a video saved in the Photo Library into frames, and the application of our photo mosaic algorithm to each frame which can then be stitched back together into a photo mosaic'd video.

#### Demo
 - We can demonstrate the app live on an iPhone, by taking a picture live and having the application generate a composite mosaic of that image on the spot with both a naive and parallel implementation.

## Background 
______
Our application is a Swift mobile app with a fairly simple user interface; the user selects the desired image (referred to as the _reference photo_) and adjusts the grid size and quality. At this point, the application reassembles the selected image (into the _composite photo_) of the other images in the users' libraries, presenting the user with the _composite_ as a final result.

Our goal was to implement a reasonable approach to transforming photos into a feature vector, apply this transformation efficiently to the entire Photo Library, and then find the minimum difference between the vector of a subsection of our reference photo and the vector of some photo from the photo library so that we can replace it. 

#### Platform Choice & Resources 

Mosaix made the most sense on a mobile device because that's the platform on which a majority of our everyday photos are taken and stored. Creating a mobile app made it easy for the end user to take a photo and see a live result, and made sharing the composite image much simpler. 

In particular, our choice of iOS 10 on iPhone 7 is driven mostly by the inclusion of the Metal framework, which gave us unprecendented low-level access to the GPU on the iPhone 7. Not only was the hardware specifically designed with photo processing in mind, but the software gave us complete control over multi-threading and image processing and a simple way of accessing a library of existing photos.

#### Major Challenges
- We'd never worked with Swift 3 or Metal before, and iOS apps are developed using a unique design paradigm, and custom interfaces and data types with restrictions upon how and when they can be used. For example, photos in the Photo Library are stored as and are accessible only as PHAssets, whereas Metal primarily supports MTLTextures and all transformations performed upon photos had to be upon textures in order to run in the kernel.  
- The iPhone 7 is quad-core, but application usage is restricted, and there is no interface to directly schedule jobs to cores. If an application uses too much power, the application is throttled down, so achieving speedup required a balance between utilizing resources and overreaching our limits. 
- Fetching photos from the Photo Library is bandwidth-bound, and repeatedly accessing photos from it, or even queuing multiple requests for specific photos, caused slowdown and had to be worked around.
- 2GB of RAM meant that holding all (or even a reasonable fraction) of photos from the Photo Library in memory efficiently was not possible, and so batch processing and converting to simplified representations of the photos as soon as possible was necessary.

## Approach 
______

There were two main algorithms we parallelized.
<ol>
  <li><em>Generating a reasonable representation of photos within the Photo Library so that we can efficiently detect what the best match for a particular subsection of our reference photo is.</em>
  
  We did this with a technique we called Ten Point Averaging (derivative of a nine point average system), which split each library photo into a 3x3 grid and found the average R, G, and B values in each subsection, as well as the average R, G, and B values for the entire image. We then created a 30-dimensional feature vector of these 10 numbers x 3 channels, and considered this as our representation of the image for candidate selection.
  </li>
  <li><em>Breaking down the reference photo into sections and choosing a single "best" image to represent each section in the composite image.</em>
  
  To choose a best image, each of the subsections of the reference photo reduce across the feature vectors of all of the photos in the photo library, attempting to identify candidate photos with lower absolute differences between their feature vectors. The resulting best fit is then used to replace that subsection of the photo. 
  </li>
</ol>

## Results
______

Our main achievement was a stable application that detects edges well and produces high-quality photo mosaics for any reference photo using a Photo Library of anywhere from 4 to 15,000 photos. Below, we've outlined further key results and observations about our application. We wrote <a href="https://github.com/shellyb/mosaix/blob/master/Mosaix/Mosaix/MosaicCreationTimer.swift">a benchmarking framework</a> to time different sections of our code, and identify what settings of thread-related parameters was optimaml.

  <em>A graph describing image selection speed-up as thread group width changed.</em>
</p>

In Metal, a thread group is a group of related threads that execute on a single compute unit, and share memory and barriers (similar to the CUDA paradigm of thread blocks). This is the graph of time taken in the image selection process as the thread group width for that particular process is varied - the kernels we wrote to carry out this process are <a href="https://github.com/shellyb/mosaix/blob/master/Mosaix/Mosaix/TenPointAveraging.metal">here</a>. Speedup increases dramatically as the width approaches 32, and then gets slightly worse. We believe that with more than 32 threads, the amount of work assigned to each thread was so little that its benefit was outweighed by the _overhead of launching and maintaining these threads_. Also, a thread group width that was too large is bandwidth-bound in its memory access and can cause cache thrashing - to improve _spatial locality_, 32 threads is the ideal thread group width.

  <em>A chart showing time spent on each portion of the algorithm's process.</em>
</p>

We timed each portion of the application's processing to try to understand where the application spent the most time. Our final iteration of the application demonstrated time spent as in the pie chart - it's clear to see that overhead, loading from file, and drawing outweigh computation time. This suggests that further optimization should look at reducing reliance on iOS functionality, as the arithmetic intensity of our application is currently quite low - the most time is spent on producing the appropriate input and output for our algorithm.

  <em>A graph describing performance of Mosaix (our application) against Mosaica and PhotoMosaic, the leading photo mosaic applications currently available in the App Store.</em>
</p>

We compared our application's performance against that of two of the most popular photo mosaic applications available in the App Store. All three applications have quality adjustment, so we adjusted the quality of the different applications until they produced visually simular quality of photo mosaics. It's clear that all three algorithms have fairly different algorithms for photo processing - for example, Photo Mosaic goes through the Photo Library _after_ a reference photo is picked, which indicates that it likely does all Photo Library processing as a per-photo diff relative to the reference photo. We timed how long each application required to create a photo mosaic after a reference photo was chosen, and found that our application was approximately _20x faster_ than either of the competitors.
